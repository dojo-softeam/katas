rules

1 write exactly ONE failing test
2 make the test from (1) pass by first writing implementation code IN THE TEST
3 create a new implementation method/function by:
3.1 doing extract method on implementation code created as per (2), or
3.2 moving implementation code as per (2) into an existing implementation method
4 only ever create new methods IN THE TEST CLASS
5 only ever create implementation classes to provide a destination for extracting a method created as per (4).
6 populate implementation classes by doing move method from a test class into them
7 refactor as required
8 go to (1)
